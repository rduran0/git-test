# Git Operations Demo

A dummy project will be included here at some point. Meanwhile this is just meant to have this single file to demonstrate the use of git commands.

What you are currently seen is the initial version of this file. Through commits you'll see this file transform.

## Git commands involved

With each update, the text and content of this section will change.

### git add
This command lets git know that a new change is to be staged/considered as part of the next commit. It accepts relative routes to specify one or more files.

* File specific route:
> git add README.md

* Indicating the whole content of the folder:
> git add .

* All files that have .md extension in the current folder:
> git add ./*.md

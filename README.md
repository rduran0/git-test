# Git Operations Demo

A dummy project will be included here at some point. Meanwhile this is just meant to have this single file to demonstrate the use of git commands.


## Start

What you are currently seen is the initial version of this file. Through commits you'll see this file transform.

### Git commands involved

With each update, the text and content of this section will change.

### git add
This command lets git know that a new change is to be staged/considered as part of the next commit. It accepts relative routes to specify one or more files.

> git add README.md

> git add .

> git add ./*.md
